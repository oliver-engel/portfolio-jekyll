I":<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.boundless.com/">Boundless Immigration</a> offers affordable green card application aid through a high-touch process that takes most customers multiple months to complete.</h3>

<h5>While the company had previously built myriad products to reduce manual processes and craft a more fluid customer experience, the bulk of its communications still took place over email. We gave status updates, instructions, important legal information… they were more akin to novels than emails.</h5>

<h5>Dozens of long emails meant that customers would (understandably!) lose track of important information, leading to high rates of customer support reach-out.</h5>

<p class="subhead">02. My Role</p>

<h3>I led a significant portion of the end-to-end design process for a customer dashboard that responds to our growing reach-out rate and simplifies many aspects of the customer experience.</h3>
<h5>This project is complete, and I’m working ‘round the clock to upload it here!</h5>
