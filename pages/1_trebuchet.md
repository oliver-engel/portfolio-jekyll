<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### I helped create a STEM education kit for Microsoft Educationâ€™s [Hacking STEM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/education-workshop/activity-library.aspx). It involves a papercraft trebuchet, Arduino circuitry, and a whole lot of prototyping.

##### This project is finished, and I'm bustin' my ass to get it up here. Stay tuned.
