<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### As part of a successful green card application, [Boundless Immigration](https://www.boundless.com/) needs to collect dozens of difficult-to-obtain documents from customers.
##### The process can take some customers weeks or months to complete. Moreover, a Boundless team member needs to look at every single uploaded document. We had a backlog of <span style="color:$red">20,000 documents</span><sup>1</sup> that weren't budging.

      <p>A glacial pace: over a month and a half, our backlog of documents needing review only shrank by about 5%.</p>

<p class="subhead">02. My Role</p>

### I led the redesign of an internal review tool, a customer-facing upload tool, and changes to our operational models to address a frustrating customer experience and reduce our backlog.

##### This is an ongoing project. More deets soon.
