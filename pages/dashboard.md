<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### [Boundless Immigration](https://www.boundless.com/) offers affordable green card application aid through a high-touch process that takes most customers multiple months to complete.

##### While the company had previously built myriad products to reduce manual processes and craft a more fluid customer experience, the bulk of its communications still took place over email. We gave status updates, instructions, important legal information... they were more akin to novels than emails.

##### Dozens of long emails meant that customers would (understandably!) lose track of important information, leading to high rates of customer support reach-out.


<p class="subhead">02. My Role</p>

### I led a significant portion of the end-to-end design process for a customer dashboard that responds to our growing reach-out rate and simplifies many aspects of the customer experience.
##### This project is complete, and I'm working 'round the clock to upload it here!
