<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### As part of a startup competition at the University of Washington, I joined a group of MBAs & engineers to develop a product demo and sales pitch to give at [Pioneer Square Labs](https://www.psl.com/).

##### This project is finished, and I'm bustin' my ass to get it up here. Stay tuned.
