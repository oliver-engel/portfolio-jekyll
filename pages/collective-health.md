<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### I had the privilege of joining Collective Healthâ€™s Design Systems team, where I helped develop a design system for the iOS & Android consumer apps.

##### I learned a great deal about the level of detail that goes into a design system by working extensively with type, colors, icons & more. Details comin' at ya when I get the chance.
